## Recommendations

Netflix is very popular in US with over 37% of content belonging to it. Because of this, it is important to focus on other countries having lesser content.  
By analyzing Netflix data, we have come up with following recommendations:

- Content should be released on platform during the month of July, December and January.
- Content should not be released during the month of February.
- More movies should be produced/added to Netflix as movies are more popular than TV shows. 
- Netflix should added more content in International movies, Dramas and Comedies genres.
- Movie timings should be around 120 minutes.
- TV shows should contain 1 season as these are more popular than shows having multiple season. 
- In Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, TV shows are more popular than movies. More TV shows should be produced in these countries.
- Movies should be added to Netflix within 1 year of release date.
- Netflix should add more of classic tv shows to their platform for catering to older audiences.
